# DeepLearning_BrainTumorsClassification

## 1. About this project

Everything is explained in the pdf file named "**ProjectReport**". However, as it is written in French, this README file will explain the main points in English.
Let's start with a short presentation of the different files:

1. **Folders**

  - A directory with random images taken from the internet : **MoreData**
  - A directory created automatically during the execution of the code that will partition our dataset : **brain_tumor_dataset**

2. **Files** 

  - Our French report delivered as part of this school project  : **ProjectReport.pdf**
  - Our model trained and saved without Data Augmentation : **model_trained_noDA.h5** 
  - Another model, trained this time with Data Augmentation : **model_trained_augmented.h5**
  - All the requirements needed to execute the whole jupyter notebook : **requirements.txt**

This project was done in a school context with two other classmates. The scope and the subject were free.
We decided to specialize more specifically in **Deep Learning** to have this first experience instead of doing only a Machine Learning project with regression or classification as the rest of the class was doing.
In addition to that, we chose a topic related to the **medical field** because we are interested in these applications and are clearly interested in **pursuing a career in data science applied to medicine**.
